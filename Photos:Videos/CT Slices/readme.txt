Filenames refer to the slice number. In total there were 6 lesions (3 per lung), so it took 6 slices to visualize all of them. We took scans in 7 equally-spaced intervals from 0% to 100% inflation of the lungs to create these animations. The lesions were tracked using MATLAB, and the motion of their centroids is shown. Our initial inflation of the lungs was a bit too little, so the lungs collapse slightly at the most deflated position. This would be easily rectified by adding a little more air.
